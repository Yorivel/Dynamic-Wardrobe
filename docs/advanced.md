# Advanced Setup

Now that you've got the basics down, let's make V's wardrobe smarter. Instead of one `outdoor` outfit for the entire city, you can have different looks for different parts of Night City.

## Region Keywords

Four broad keywords cover whole groups of locations at once:

| Keyword | Where It Applies |
|---------|-----------------|
| **corpo** | Corpo Plaza, City Center, Downtown, North Oaks, Charter Hill, Arasaka Waterfront, Japantown |
| **street** | Glen, Wellsprings, Arroyo, Little China, Kabuki, Northside, Rancho Coronado, Vista Del Rey |
| **wild** | Badlands, South Badlands, North Badlands, Pacifica, Coastview, West Wind Estate, Dogtown |
| **club** | Afterlife, Riot Club, Lizzie's Bar, Clouds, Dark Matter, Totentaz, Embers, El Coyote Cojo |

<details>
<summary>Example</summary>

V's outfits: **`outdoor`**, **`corpo elegant`**, **`street tough`**, **`club party`**

* At Corpo Plaza → **`corpo elegant`**
* In Kabuki → **`street tough`**
* At the Afterlife → **`club party`**
* In the Badlands → **`outdoor`** (no `wild` outfit, so the default kicks in)

</details>

These mappings are customizable — see [Context Map](context-map.md) for details.

## Stacking Keywords

Combine region keywords for more specific matching. If an outfit has multiple region keywords, they all need to match — and more keywords means higher priority.

**`corpo club vip`** only kicks in at clubs in corpo areas (like Clouds in Japantown). At a street club like Lizzie's Bar, it won't apply.

<summary>Example</summary>

V's outfits: **`outdoor`**, **`corpo casual`**, **`club fancy`**, **`corpo club vip`**, **`afterlife`**

* At the Afterlife → **`afterlife`** (exact location always wins)
* At Clouds (corpo + club) → **`corpo club vip`** (2 keywords beat 1)
* At Lizzie's Bar (street + club) → **`club fancy`** (`corpo club vip` doesn't apply — not a corpo area)
* At Corpo Plaza (corpo, no club) → **`corpo casual`**
* In the Badlands → **`outdoor`**

</details>

## Location Keywords

For exact control over a specific spot, press **F10** in-game to see your current location name (e.g. `Badlands_RedPeaks`), then name an outfit using any word from that name. See [All Location Enums](location-enums.md) for the complete list.

The mod is flexible — `badlands` in your outfit name will match `southbadlands` in the location too. A specific location match always beats a region keyword match.

Use separators to share one outfit across multiple locations: **`badlands/coastview`** works in both.

<summary>Example</summary>

V's outfits: **`outdoor casual`**, **`street tough`**, **`afterlife`**, **`badlands/coastview rugged`**

* At the Afterlife → **`afterlife`** (exact location beats the `street` region match)
* In Kabuki → **`street tough`** (region match, no exact location outfit)
* In Badlands or Coastview → **`badlands/coastview rugged`** (separator = either location)
* In Japantown → **`outdoor casual`** (Japantown is `corpo`, not `street` — no match, falls back to outdoor)

</details>
